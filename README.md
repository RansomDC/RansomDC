Hello there! My name is Ransom Cadorette and I am a software developer looking to dive right into the industry and make big changes. Technologies I have experience in include: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Django, SQL, C#, and ASP.Net core.  

If you see anything interesting in my repositories feel free to send me a message asking about them, I would love to collaborate on projects and I'm always looking for new ways to expand skillset

You can contact me at my website:

As I'm applying for jobs I'm currently working on two small projects.

1. The ror-randomizer. This is a webpage that randomizes items that you can pick for the videogame Risk of Rain 2. A variant of play that me and a few of my friends do
2. DnD-form-fillable. This is just a little pet project to make what is effectively just a calculator for a DnD charachter sheets so that you can quickly type in some
   info and get your stats back. Still in the very early stages!
