Hello there! My name is Ransom Cadorette and I am a relatively new coder / programmer. Currently most of my coding experience has been in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
But I'm branching out into SQL, Python and Ruby as well.

If you see anythinginteresting in my repositories feel free to send me a message asking about them, I would love to collaborate on projects and get more experience 
under my belt.

You can contact me at my website:

I'm currently working on two (for me) big projects.

1. The ror-randomizer. This is a webpage that randomizes items that you can pick for the videogame Risk of Rain 2. A variant of play that me and a few of my friends do
2. DnD-form-fillable. This is just a little pet project to make what is effectively just a calculator for a DnD charachter sheets so that you can quickly type in some
   info and get your stats back. Still in the very early stages!
